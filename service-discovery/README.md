# Service Discovery Server

## Brief

This is a very simple Eureka server that handles service discovery server side operations

## Setup

No real effort for this one ... just start it

###### Note:

If you want to run it on a different host other than localhost, Then you need to update all microservices'
application.properties to point to the new host this is a configuration enhancement that can be considered later
